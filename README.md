# Quotex 1 Minute Strategy: Trade Binary Options in 60 Seconds

The 1-minute (60-second) binary options strategy is a fast-paced trading
strategy that can be used to make quick profits. This strategy is based
on the idea that the price of an asset will move in a certain direction
within the next 60 seconds. If you can correctly predict the direction
of the price movement, you can make a profit by buying or selling an
option.
